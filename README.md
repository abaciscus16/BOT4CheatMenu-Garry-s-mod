# BOT4CheatMenu-Garry-s-mod
Welcome to my first Github repository, it will be dedicated to my own .lua cheat on Garry's mod. Features:

Aimobt(Auto shoot, Snapline, Fov Circle, predict target, noSpread, noRecoil)

ESP(Corner)

HP(Bar+Text) 

Armor(Bar+Text) 

Ammo(Bar+Text)
 
Player Name 

BunnyHop 

The cheat does not have any protection or antiscreengrab built in, I will keep working on the software as long as I'm interested

One of the main features my cheats full open code. You can change it any way you want right during the game.

doesn't work on community servers with sv_allowcslua = 0, screengrab and cheat engine protect
