# BOT4CheatMenu-Garry-s-mod
Welcome to my first Github repository, it will be dedicated to my own .lua cheat on Garry's mod. Features:
 
ESP(Corner)

HP(Bar+Text) 

Armor(Bar+Text) 

Ammo(Bar+Text)
 
Player Name 

BunnyHop 

The cheat does not have any protection or antiscreengrab built in, I will keep working on the software as long as I'm interested
One of the main features my cheats full open code. You can change it any way you want right during the game.

Use Garry's mod without Beta-versions. Drop BOT4CheatMenu.lua to Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\autorun\client. And when you connect to server insert command to console lua_openscript_cl autorun/client/BOT4CheatMenu.lua
